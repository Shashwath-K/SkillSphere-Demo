## Workflow: How to Contribute Code

1.  **Find or Create an Issue**
    * Look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/Shashwath-K/SkillSphere-CAT/issues) to see if your bug or feature is already being discussed.
    * If you find one, please comment on the issue to express your interest before you start working. This prevents duplicate efforts.
    * If you don't find one, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/Shashwath-K/SkillSphere-CAT/issues/new) detailing your suggestion or problem.

2.  **Create a New Branch**
    * Make sure you are on the `main` branch and have the latest changes:
        ```bash
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        ```
    * Create a descriptive new branch for your feature or fix:
        ```bash
        # For a new feature
        git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature

        # For a bug fix
        git checkout -b fix/button-alignment
        ```

3.  **Make Your Changes**
    * Write your code!
    * Adhere to the coding standards and style guides used in the project.
    * Ensure your code is formatted correctly (we recommend using a tool like Prettier).

4.  **Test Your Changes**
    * Before committing, thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce new issues.
    * If applicable, add or update unit tests for any new functionality.

5.  **Commit Your Changes**
    * Write clear and meaningful commit messages. We follow the **Conventional Commits** standard.
    * **Format:** `type(scope): subject`
    * **Examples:**
        * `feat(auth): add user registration form`
        * `fix(nav): correct mobile menu overlap`
        * `docs(readme): update setup instructions`
        * `style(home): adjust hero section padding`
        * `refactor(api): simplify course fetching logic`

6.  **Push and Open a Pull Request (PR)**
    * Push your branch to your fork:
        ```bash
        git push -u origin feat/my-new-feature
        ```
    * Go to the main SkillSphere repository and you will see a prompt to open a new Pull Request.
    * In your PR description, link to the issue it resolves (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    * Keep PRs focused on a single change. This makes them much easier and faster to review.
